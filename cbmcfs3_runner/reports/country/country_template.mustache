Country report for "{{short_name}}" ({{iso2_code}})
===================================================

General information
-------------------
This is an country report that can include information from several scenarios.

Processing
----------
* This report and all the analysis was generated using the `{{project_name}}` python pipeline at:

<{{project_url}}>

* Version `{{project_version}}` of the pipeline was used.

* This document was generated at `{{now}}` on host `{{hostname}}`.

{{#git}}
* The exact git hash of the latest commit was: {{git_hash}}

* Also more simply referred to by its shortened tag `{{git_tag}}`.

Comparison of predicted inventory
---------------------------------
Below we compare the outcome between the two different scenarios `static_demand` and `calibration` (respectively) by
taking their "predicted inventory at simulation end" graphs.

{{inventory_at_end_static}}

{{inventory_at_end_calib}}

{{inventory_discrepancy}}

Comparison of predicted stock
-----------------------------
Total merchantable biomass stock per forest type.
It's an indication of the overall evolution of the growing stock (not yet disturbed).
This is useful for making a high level checks.
The mass is measured as millions of tons of carbon.

Comparison of harvest fulfillment
---------------------------------
Below we compare the outcome between the two different scenarios `static_demand` and `calibration` (respectively) by
taking their "expected harvest against the provided harvest" graphs.
